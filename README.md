#Date:2021/12/29
#Data exploration exercise from geeksforgeek.com
#I expanded upon their initial lesson by adding the user input
#and adding the freqs, times, and mean speeds of nico and sanne
#Keyword args: "long-lat", "map", "freqs", "times", "mean-speed or "gui"
#plots and compares three bird gps data
#long/lat of birds paths and then overlayed
#on a cartographic map. mean daily speed,
#the speed frequency and elapsed times are also analyzed
#added a gui... for fun
